"""Fused MoE layer TKG stage kernels -- the megakernel building blocks.

post_attn_norm (input RMSNorm) -> {routed_experts, shared_expert, sigma_gate} -> gated sum (moe_layer).

All consumers read the SAME SBUF ``normed_sb`` (norm once, zero HBM round-trip); ``moe_layer_compose``
returns the single per-rank partial ``routed_local + g * shared_local`` for one downstream all-reduce.
